        <p>The Brooklyn Vignettes is a monthly podcast produced by me, Fraser Tye*, for Radio Free Brooklyn. The show provides brief, unscripted moments usually given by strangers who I approach in public. Other times, they are moments provided by friends of mine, or people I've met online. </p>
        <p>Due to the current COVID-19 virus, these are being recorded over the phone and not in person. As always however, they are told by those living in this weird and wonderful place we call home, Brooklyn, NY.  </p>
